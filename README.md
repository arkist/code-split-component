# code-split-component

A React Component and a Babel 6 plugin to support code splitting in Webpack 2 powered projects.

___Confession___

_This work has been completely ripped off from Sunil Pai's (@threepointone) original work. I highly recommend you go see his work before adopting this.  The main differences of this lib compared to his is that this lib is built to target Webpack 2, and is much much much simpler (i.e. severely lacking in features).  I built it to meet a specific use case for my [universal starter kit](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally)._

## Dependencies

Your project needs to be using React, Webpack 2 and Babel 6.

## About

This library consists of a React Component and a Babel 6 plugin that allows you to easily define Webpack 2 code split points within your application.

## Installation

`npm install code-split-component --save`

##Â Usage

First you need to add the babel plugin.

```
{
  "plugins": ["code-split-component/babel"]
}
```

Then use the `CodeSplitComponent` within your application to load one of your components.  This component will automatically be used as a code split point. 

To do this you have to provide a string literal to the `path` prop of the `CodeSplitComponent`.  This must be a relative path to the component that you are trying to load and have code splitting occur on. NOTE: You can't pass a variable/function etc to resolve the `path` with - it has to be a string literal.

In addition to the `path` prop you need to define a `function` as a child to the `CodeSplitComponent`.  This `function` will receive a single argument, which will be your component.  If the argument is `null` then your component bundle hasn't been fetched from the server yet.

Here is an example:

```jsx
import CodeSplitComponent from 'code-split-component'

<CodeSplitComponent path="../FooComponent">
  { FooComponent => (FooComponent ? <FooComponent /> : <div>Loading...</div>) }
</CodeSplitComponent>
```

## Examples

### Fully featured

This lib was built for use within the [react-universally](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally) starter kit. This starter kit provides you with a minimal configuration to get going with a server side rendering React application. 

I haven't completed the integration of `code-split-component` into the starter kit yet, however, you can preview the current usage within the [`next`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally/tree/next) branch.

### Code split React Router 4 routes

You can quite easily split on your react router routes by doing the following:

```js
import { Match } from 'react-router';
import CodeSplitComponent from 'code-split-component';

<Match
  pattern="/foo"
  render={() =>
    <CodeSplitComponent path="./Foo">
      { Foo => (Foo ? <Foo /> : <div>Loading...</div>) }
    </CodeSplitComponent>
  }
/>
```

Pretty simple. :)

## Caveats / FAQs

### Hot Reloading

HMR won't work if you have the code splitting enabled. However, there is an easy workaround. Simply update your Babel config and set up the `env` section so that the code splitting will only be enabled for your production build.

e.g.

```
{
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "plugins": [["code-split-component/babel", { "noCodeSplitting": true }]]
    },
    "production": {
      "plugins": ["code-split-component/babel"]
    }
  }
}
```

Remember you need to have set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable to either "development" or "production" for the above to work.
